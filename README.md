## üéØ Purpose of Forecasting in Healthcare

Forecasting plays a crucial role in **medical planning, resource allocation, and policy design**.  
It helps anticipate healthcare demands and avoid critical service gaps in several scenarios:

- **Environmental Triggers:** Predict hospital visits during high AQI or heatwave periods.  
- **Emergency Events:** Manage staff and equipment for disease outbreaks or natural disasters.  
- **Chronic Disease Planning:** Forecast long-term care needs for diabetes, obesity, and addiction.  
- **Syndromic Surveillance:** Detect early spikes in symptoms to prevent outbreak escalation.  
- **Prognosis and Personalized Medicine:** Predict disease progression for individualized treatment.

> **Goal:** Enable data-backed decisions that improve patient care, reduce operational costs, and enhance readiness during high-risk situations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Study Methodology: Comparative Forecasting Analysis

A **comparative study** was conducted using **two datasets** ‚Äî a smaller healthcare dataset and the larger, more diverse **MIMIC-IV dataset** ‚Äî to predict emergency department admissions and evaluate model performance.

### **Steps Followed:**

1. **Outlier Detection:**  
   Visualized using boxplots and line graphs to identify extreme values.

3. **Quantifying Outliers (Tukey‚Äôs Method):**  
   Calculated **Interquartile Range (IQR)** and adjusted values 1.5√óIQR in both directions.

4. **Handling Missing Data:**  
   Replaced missing entries with **median substitution** to maintain consistency.

5. **Feature Encoding:**  
   Applied **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables:  
   *Gender*, *Hospital Attendance*, *Triage Disposition*, *Admission Outcome*.

6. **Model Training:**  
   Implemented five ML algorithms across both datasets:  
   **Random Forest (RF):** Ensemble of decision trees for robust results.

    **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Distance-based classification.

    **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Maximizes class separation.

   **Recursive Partitioning (RPART):** Tree-based decision splits.
   
   <img width="512" height="366" alt="RPART" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb0c48f7-8aa5-43c0-aa37-d27b80f496d5" />

    **SVM (Radial Kernel):** Finds the optimal hyperplane for data separation.

8. **Validation:**  
   Applied **10-fold cross-validation** to minimize overfitting and ensure generalization.

Overfitting and underfitting
Overfitting means when the model learns the training data too well and gets adjusted specifically to the given dataset. This creates limitations for the model as it won‚Äôt be able to perform well if some different data is given for prediction.
Underfitting means the model is very simple and is unable to capture the underlying trends on the dataset. So the forecast is inaccurate.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was assessed using three standard metrics:

| Metric | Description | Formula |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **AUC-ROC** | Measures overall classification accuracy | 0.5 = random, 1 = perfect |
| **Sensitivity (Recall)** | Detects positive cases accurately | `TP / (TP + FN)` |
| **Specificity** | Identifies negative cases correctly | `TN / (TN + FP)` |

> Together, these metrics ensure a balanced and interpretable view of forecast performance across patient classes.
